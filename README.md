# Minesweeper
A Minesweeper implementation <br>
I was inspired to make a game in Python and Minesweeper has been a game I've loved playing recently.
I created the game in Python using PyGame for the GUI. It has simple solver tools.
I am currently recreating the game (with a GUI) in C++ and hope to add a full solver in addition to the base game.
